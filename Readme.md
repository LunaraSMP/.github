# Welcome to the LunaraSMP Wiki! ðŸš€

Embark on a cosmic adventure in the LunaraSMP, a modded Minecraft server where space and technology reign supreme! We're powered by NeoForge 1.21.1 and fueled by a galaxy of mods, including **Create, Ad Astra, AE2**, and many more.  But that's not all! We also craft our *own* mods, expanding the Minecraft universe with new items, mobs, biomes, and beyond!  Prepare to explore the unknown and push the boundaries of what's possible in Minecraft. 

## Mod List

### Description 

Our **Official LunaraSMP Modrinth Modpack**, which is used on the LunaraSMP server, focuses on space and technology. It includes mods like `Create`, `Ad Astra`, and `Applied Energistics 2`. 
### Updates:
Unless there are urgent updates needed, (which get updated right away), the modpack/server will update quarterly, (every 3 months). 
### Mod List
Here is a list of the main mods required, and that are included in the Modrinth Modpack. This list does *not* contain the dependencies required. The modpack does, however. (we currently are *not* on CurseForge, but we may be in the future)
